/**
 * This class can be used to perform an http get or an http post. It takes
 * a shared pointer to a QNetworkAccessManager, and it uses signals and slots
 * to make sure that the QNetworkAccessManager functions are only called in
 * the main thread (the main event loop). This way, HttpRequestManager
 * functions can be used in threads other than the main thread.
 *
 * HttpRequestManager stores a map of pending replies and received replies,
 * and it emits a signal when a new reply is received. When a new get or
 * post is sent, the function returns a requestId to keep track of the request.
